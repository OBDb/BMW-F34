    description: "The BMW F34 3 Series Gran Turismo was a unique variant in the sixth-generation 3 Series lineup, featuring a fastback body style that combined elements of sedan, wagon, and crossover designs. Based on the long-wheelbase version of the 3 Series platform, the F34 was 200mm longer than the standard sedan, with a 110mm longer wheelbase, offering significantly more rear legroom and cargo space. The raised seating position (59mm higher than the sedan) provided better visibility and easier entry/exit. Engine options mirrored those of the standard 3 Series, ranging from efficient four-cylinder diesel and petrol units to powerful six-cylinder engines in models like the 335i/340i. All F34 models came standard with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and many variants offered xDrive all-wheel drive. Distinctive styling elements included a actively deploying rear spoiler, frameless windows, and a unique tailgate design. A facelift in 2016 updated the styling, technology features, and engine lineup. Despite offering practical advantages over the standard 3 Series models, the Gran Turismo remained a niche product in BMW's lineup, appealing to buyers seeking extra space without moving to an SUV or traditional wagon. Production ended in 2020 with no direct replacement, as BMW streamlined its model range."
